#### Chun Shen Lim, Brooke N. Weinstein, Scott W. Roy, Chris M. Brown. (2020). Analysis of fungal genomes reveals commonalities of intron loss/gain and functions in intron-poor species. bioRxiv. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.11.247098

This repository contains the alignment files and phylogenetic tree file to reproduce the ancestral intron reconstruction in the paper using the graphical user interface in [Malin](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~csuros/introns/malin/). It also contains the results files from our analysis and a python script used to calculate the total length of CDS in the ortholog alignments for each species.
