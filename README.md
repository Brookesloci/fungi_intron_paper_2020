This repository contains the alignment files and phylogenetic tree file to reproduce the ancestral intron reconstruction in the paper using the graphical user interface in [Malin](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~csuros/introns/malin/). It also contains the results files from our analysis and a python script used to calculate the total length of CDS in the alignments for each species.
