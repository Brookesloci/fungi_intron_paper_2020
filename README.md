#### Chun Shen Lim, Brooke N. Weinstein, Scott W. Roy, Chris M. Brown. (2020) Comparative analysis of hundreds of fungal genomes reveals commonalities of intron loss and gain evolution and suggests general intron functions in intron-poor species. DOI:

This repository contains the alignment files and phylogenetic tree file to reproduce the ancestral intron reconstruction in the paper using the graphical user interface in [Malin](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~csuros/introns/malin/). It also contains the results files from our analysis and a python script used to calculate the total length of CDS in the ortholog alignments for each species.
