A custom GTF file of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that contains UTR annotation.
- useful for generating the null distributions in Fig 7.
- produced using the GTF file from 
[Ensembl Fungi 34](https://bit.ly/2y0hYxg) and 
UTR annotation from [YeastMine](https://yeastmine.yeastgenome.org/yeastmine/begin.do).
For each gene, only the longest UTR(s) was chosen.
